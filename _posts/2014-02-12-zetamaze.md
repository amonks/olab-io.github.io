[Zetamaze](http://zetamaze.com) is a collaborative web game that allows users to edit, draw on, and explore a virtual maze. The actions of each visitor affect the experience of others who play the game after them. Each visitor is equally empowered to share their artwork and ideas by utilizing the unique methods of collaborative construction, mark making, and file sharing that the project presents. With it, the artist has created a space and a proposition; however, the project itself lives and grows on the web driven by the creative decisions of those who participate.

Some [interesting things](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/crowdsourced-digital-gallery-accidentally-amasses-treasure-trove-of-shrek-fan-art) happened after its release.
