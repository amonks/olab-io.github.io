The [threejs_playGnd](http://threejsplaygnd.brangerbriz.net/) is a digital literacy (agency) artware + ntro to [three.js/webGL](http://threejs.org) (interactive/generative 3D in the browser) which is modeled after an experimental new-media art ethic.

I mean 'ethic' not in the traditional 'moral' sense, but in the general sense: as a set of principles for practice in accordance with some convention. In this case the 'practice' is an experimental new-media art one; rather than traditional approaches to programming centered around 'best practices' + conventions (stability, structure, hierarchy, clear goals, debugging) the _playGnd is instead modeled on new-media ethics (experimenting, playing, copying+pasting, remixing, sharing). You learn to + make webGL sketches (using the three.js library) by ‘considerately fux’n around’. The _playGnd has three sections: the [1] graphix[toCode] interface, the [2] realtime editor, && the [3] sketches archive
