Chicago 0,0 is a collaboration between the Chicago History Museum and VCD faculty [Geoffrey Alan Rhodes](http://garhodes.com/) in which the archives of Chicago street photography from the last century are brought in to the Chicago community and downtown streets.  Through the publication of an innovative Augmented Reality app for iPhone and Android, users will be able to view these rarely seen photos super-imposed onto the current landscape while standing on the same spot from which the photos were originally taken.
